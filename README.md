# Learning Bash Script

The following chapters are added :

### 1. Hello World
- It does not matter whether you actually have the `.sh` file extension or not. As long as your 
  script is executable it is okay to have any file extension.
- A valid script should contain zero or more commands.
- If you have set permissions to work as an executable file then you need not use `bash <filename>`
- The shebang (first line - #!/bin/bash) is meant to tell which interpreter is supposed to run 
  the script. Even if you shell is zsh or fish. You can use a different interpreter to run the 
  script file.
- Finally, the shebang does start with `#` and so do comments. It is the only exception.

### 2. Variables
- You can setup variables right in your shell with `varname=<var-value>` and then call them 
  using `echo $varname`. But these variables do not persist.
- You can also use existing commands as variable names like `ls = "Hello World"`. They do not 
  interfere with the working of the command.
